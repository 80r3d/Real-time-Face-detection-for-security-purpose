# Real-time-Face-detection-for-security-purpose

This project is to improve the face detection system by using Haar Classifier to get higher accuracy result. Haar Classifier is used for face detection because it can detect the desire image very fast. The algorithm has been used for the detection which achieved high detection accuracy.

Used RaspberrypI-3 as a target platform.
The program is written in python and openCV library is used for computer vision input processing.
